# Java-Endterm-Project
It's my Endterm project, I have created School management system.
Java Project Idea: School management system is another beginner level project idea that will help you implement your skills in Java. This project is developed for schools to store and manage all data and records related to school. All information related to students, teachers, and staff of the school is stored in the database. 
There are four types of users in this system: admin, student, teacher, and staff members. Admin handles the whole system and has rights to access the data of other users. He can add, delete, and modify the records of students, teachers or any staff member. Teachers can keep track of attendance and enter the marks and grades obtained by the student in exams. Students can view their details including attendance and performance.
